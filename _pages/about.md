I am an assistant professor at University of Alicante.

Previously I was a data scientist at [Prompsit Language Engineering](https://www.prompsit.com), where I leaded the data processing team that built the [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net) bilingual concordancer.

I obtained my Ph.D. at University of Alicante in 2015. My advisors were Felipe Sánchez-Martínez and Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz.
